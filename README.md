# JTabViz: Java Tabular Visualization Toolkit

This project is a research project for my study of the AdaBoost algorithm from a visual perspective and representation learning. To conduct this research, I have developed **JTabViz**, a Java-based multiplatform toolkit for machine learning (ML) data analysis, classification, and visualization. It is designed for the visualization and analysis of multidimensional (n-D) tabular ML data to discover and build classification models from first order logic rules. Further, it supports data augmentation, to explore how dataset changes impact trained models.

Currently, the project supports the following classifiers:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- K Nearest Neighbors Classifier
- Linear Discriminant Analysis Classifier
- Principal Component Analysis Classifier
- Support (weighted) Sum Classifier (our invention)

We seek to combine these potentially weaker classifiers into a single stronger classifier, as AdaBoost does. Here we visualize classifier mistakes, seek improved representations, and build classification models from first order logic rules which we will later convert into Hyperblocks using our [Hyperblock Parser](https://github.com/AvaAvarai/Hyperblock_Parser).  

Users can load CSV data to view, analyze, and classify with features like normalization, General Line Coordinates (GLCs) visualizations, tabular heatmaps, covariance matrix heatmaps, row manipulation, cell editing, classification rule testing with confusion matrices, automatic pure region discovery, feature engineering using slope and distance calculations, weighted sum features; including trigonometric wrapping, forward/backward differences, and various trigonometric values, optimal coefficient computation for weighted sums, attribute sorting, and data export.

This application has been tested on Windows (10/11), Linux (Pop!_OS), and macOS (M3 Sonoma) and is designed to run on any platform with a Java runtime environment.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the build script from the project root directory. The script requires Java Development Kit (JDK) to be installed.

On macOS/Linux:

```sh
./build.sh
```

On Windows:

```sh
./build.bat
```

This will compile the code, package it with resources into a JAR file, and run the application.

## General Line Coordinates Multidimensional Data Visualizations

GLCs generalize Cartesian Coordinates to n-D, with a subcategory being n-D to 2-D graph construction algorithms where graphs are commonly polylines, losslessly and reversibly visualizing all attributes and classes of the n-D data in 2-D space, while preserving distance relationships between points. We provide the following GLC visualizations:

| GLC Type | Acronym | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parallel Coordinates | PC | Drawing all coordinate axes in 2D located parallel to each other. |
| Shifted Paired Coordinates | SPC | Drawing each pair of attributes in 2D as a shifted cartesian plane, connecting cases with polylines. |
| Circular Coordinates | SCC & DCC | Drawing all coordinate axes in 2D as a circle, connecting cases with polylines, circle can be made a polygon or a circle either static or dynamic. |
| Star Coordinates | SC | Drawing all coordinate axes in 2D as a star shape, connecting cases with polylines. |
| Concentric Coordinates | CC | Drawing all coordinate axes in 2D as a series of circles nested within each other, connecting cases with polylines, circles can be made freeform or concentric. |
| Line Coordinates | LC | Drawing all coordinate axes in 2D located one after another on a single straight line. |

### Rule Discovery

#### Single Attribute Pure Intervals

Using a sliding window algorithm, JTabViz *automatically* identifies pure intervals within individual attributes. Only the most significant regions are used for classification, filtered by a threshold slider to ensure coverage of a class or the dataset.

#### Trigonometric Differences

JTabViz applies trigonometric functions to forward differences, backward differences, and direct attribute values to uncover patterns and interactions in the data:

- sin: Emphasizes periodic or cyclic relationships between attributes, making it easier to detect recurring patterns.
- cos: Highlights rotational or angular relationships between attributes, helping to uncover how attributes might cyclically influence each other.
- tan: Focuses on the rate of change between attributes, useful for identifying steep trends or shifts in the data.

#### Application of Trigonometric Functions

- Forward Differences: The trigonometric functions are applied to the differences between each attribute value and the next one in the sequence. This highlights how changes from one data point to the next evolve cyclically, rotationally, or in terms of their rate of change.
- Backward Differences: Similar to forward differences, but here the trigonometric functions are applied to the differences between each attribute value and the previous one. This can help in understanding how past values influence current trends, especially in a cyclical or rotational context.
- Direct Attribute Values: Trigonometric functions are directly applied to the raw attribute values themselves. This approach reveals inherent periodicity, rotation, or trends in the data, independent of any sequence-based differences.

#### Feature Engineering with Weighted Sum for Data Classification

JTabViz allows for the creation of **Weighted Sum Features** from existing attributes, enhancing class separability, reducing dimensionality, and improving model representation. A new feature created by combining multiple existing features using a set of coefficients.

New Feature} = c_1(x_1) + c_2(x_2) + ... + c_n(x_n)

where:
c_1, c_2, ..., c_n are the coefficients.  
x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are the original features.

#### Automatic Coefficient Optimization with Gradient Descent

JTabViz includes a gradient descent algorithm that optimizes coefficients to maximize between-class variance and minimize within-class variance, ensuring effective class separation.

#### Wrapping Weighted Sum with Trigonometric Functions

Apply trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, and their inverses) to Weighted Sum features to reveal non-linear relationships and rotational patterns.

#### Practical Example

Suppose you have a dataset with features `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`:

New Feature = 0.5(x1) + 0.3(x2) - 0.2(x3)

Wrapped with cos function:

Transformed Feature = cos(0.5(x1) + 0.3(x2) - 0.2(x3))

This transformation can provide deeper insights and improve classification.

#### Feature Engineering with Slope-Distance

JTabViz can insert columns of features engineered with slope and distance calculations to explore relationships between pairs of numeric attributes:

Slope: Measures the rate of change between two attributes, calculated as:
`slope = (Y2 − Y1) / (X2 − X1)`

Distance: Represents the Euclidean distance between two points in 2D space, calculated as:
`distance = (X2 − X1)^2 + (Y2 − Y1)^2`

Attribute Pairing: Attributes are paired sequentially. If there are an odd number of columns, the last one is duplicated to complete the pair.

These features help identify patterns, clusters, or anomalies, in the data.

## Compiling the Application from Source

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/AvaAvarai/jtabviz.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the project:

   ```sh
   javac -d out -cp "libs/*" src/*.java
   ```

4. Run the compiled project:

   ```sh
   java -cp ".;libs/*" src.Main
   ```

   **Note:** For macOS and Linux, replace the semicolon (`;`) in the classpath (`-cp`) with a colon (`:`).

## Dataset File Format

JTabViz accepts datasets in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file format. Here are the key points about the expected data format:

1. File Extension: The data file should have a *.csv* extension.

2. Data Types:
   - Numerical data is preferred for optimal visualization and analysis.
   - Non-numerical (categorical) data and blank fields are also accepted.

3. Class Column:
   - A column representing the class or category of each data point is expected.
   - This column can appear in any position.
   - Should be titled *'class'* (case-insensitive, so 'Class' or 'CLASS' are also acceptable).
   - The class column is used for color-coding and shape assignment in various visualizations.

4. Header Row:
   - The first row of the CSV file should contain column (attribute) names.

5. Delimiter:
   - Values should be separated by commas.
